# Interactive Portfolio (Beginner Friendly)

This is a **ready-to-run** starter using **Vite + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion**.

## 1) Install the tools (one time)
- **Node.js**: https://nodejs.org (LTS). After install, open **Terminal** (or PowerShell on Windows) and check:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
- **VS Code**: https://code.visualstudio.com

## 2) Open this project in VS Code
- Extract the zip to a folder like `C:\Users\<you>\portfolio` (Windows) or `~/portfolio` (Mac).
- In VS Code: **File â†’ Open Folderâ€¦** and select the folder.

## 3) Install packages
```bash
npm install
```

## 4) Run the site locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
- VS Code will show a local URL like `http://localhost:5173`. Click it to open your site.

## 5) Edit your info
- Open `src/components/Hero.jsx` and change name/title.
- Update `About.jsx`, `Experience.jsx`, and `src/data/projects.js` with your details.
- Add your profile image later if you want (e.g., in `public/` and reference in components).

## 6) Build for production (optional)
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
- To deploy free, drag the folder **dist** into https://app.netlify.com/drop or connect a GitHub repo to Netlify/Vercel.

## Troubleshooting
- If `vite` not found: ensure `npm install` finished without errors.
- If port in use: the terminal will suggest another port; accept it.
- Windows PowerShell execution policy errors: open PowerShell **as Administrator** and run:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
  ```

Happy building! ðŸŽ‰
